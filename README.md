# Cubic Crafter

This is a little experiment of mine to see if I could recreate a basic version of Minecraft.

## Building

Before building, make sure to edit [`main.cpp`](src/main.cpp) and change the path to the directory that the included JavaScript files are kept.

## Credits

Cubic Crafter was made possible with [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview), [webview2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2), [babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js), and [noise.js](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs).
